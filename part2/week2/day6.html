        /*
        describe solution in Enlish
          we fisrt should define once, which gonna recieve a funtion.
        and inside of the once, we should define flag to keep track of if it's the first call.
        and assign false to it as initialization. and define res to hold the return value.
        and then we should return a anonymous function, which will accept some arguments.
          inside of the anonymous function, we should check if the flag is false, if so, it means this is 
        the second call, so we should return res. otherwise, we should call fn with the arguments, and set res equal
        to the return value. 
          finally we should set flag equal to ture.
